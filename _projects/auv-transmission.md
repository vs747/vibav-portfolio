## üß† Project Overview

At IIT Madras, I worked on the mechanical design of a biomimetic AUV transmission system. My role focused on reengineering the internal mechanism for space efficiency and reduced weight.

## üõ†Ô∏è Work Done

- Modeled CAD in SolidWorks  
- Performed design calculations (FOS, loads)  
- Created BOM and engineering drawings  
- Collaborated on integrating Jetson Nano for control

## üß∞ Tools Used

SolidWorks, MATLAB, Jetson Nano
