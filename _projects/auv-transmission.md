### üß† Overview  
At IIT Madras, I worked with a 4-member team to design a transmission mechanism for a biomimetic Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).

### üõ†Ô∏è Contributions
- Performed design calculations for FOS and strength
- Modeled and revised SolidWorks assemblies
- Reduced weight and improved stability while maintaining compactness
- Learned how Jetson Nano is used for control and sensor integration

### üß∞ Tools Used
SolidWorks, Jetson Nano, MATLAB, Python
